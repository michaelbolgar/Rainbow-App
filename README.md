## Description

Rainbow is a new generation game designed to enhance your cognitive abilities. During the game, colors appear on the screen, but the words are written in a different color than the name of the color. Your task is to identify the color in which the word is written.

In Rainbow, you can customize the speed and duration of the game, and there are two modes for displaying words. Additionally, you have the option to change the font size and manage the colors.

The latest feature of Rainbow is an active voice recognizer: speak words out loud, and the application will point out where you made a mistake.

Rainbow is geared towards providing active leisure with brain-boosting benefits. The challenge of associating words with their colors enhances cognitive flexibility and diverse thinking.
